        <p>
          Let’s clear this up immediately: <strong>Rentgen is not here to replace Postman.</strong>
          And pretending otherwise would be dishonest.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you live in Postman — writing scripts, crafting assertions, maintaining collections for CI,
          debugging runners at 1 a.m. — then Rentgen is not competing with that.
          Rentgen exists <strong>before</strong> all of that.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img width=100% src="../assets/api-stories/rentgen-import-curl-generate-and-run.gif" alt="Rentgen flow: cURL in, tests out" />
          <figcaption>One cURL in. Hundreds of tests out. No ceremony.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>The part of API testing everyone does — but nobody talks about</h2>
        <p>
          Most developers use Postman as an API client. Not as a testing framework.
          They import a cURL, send a request, see a response, and move on.
        </p>

        <p>
          No assertions. No edge cases. No negative testing.
          Not because they’re lazy — but because the first step is usually made unnecessarily heavy.
        </p>

        <p>
          So APIs get handed over with the classic line: <em>“I tested it. It works.”</em>
          Testers hear that sentence every week. And they already know what comes next.
        </p>

        <h2>What Rentgen is</h2>
        <p>
          Rentgen is a local-only API hygiene scanner built for one thing:
          <strong>to stress-test your assumptions</strong> before you waste time polishing a false sense of “done”.
        </p>

        <p>
          You paste a single cURL.
          You send the request.
          Then you click <strong>Generate &amp; Run Tests</strong>.
          That’s it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rentgen expands one request into a messy, realistic set of tests —
          the exact kind of inputs real systems see in production when humans (or integrations) do human things.
        </p>

        <h2>What Rentgen tests automatically</h2>
        <p>
          Not “happy path theatre”. Real hygiene.
          The boring, predictable, expensive stuff people skip until it hits prod.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Missing required fields and unexpected nulls</li>
          <li>Wrong data types (string instead of number, object instead of array, etc.)</li>
          <li>Boundary values that should be rejected cleanly</li>
          <li>Enum variations (wrong casing, invalid values, random junk)</li>
          <li>Trimming and whitespace issues (leading/trailing spaces, empty strings)</li>
          <li>Malformed payloads that should never crash a backend</li>
          <li>Status codes that look “fine” until you read what they actually mean</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>No assertions? Correct.</h2>
        <p>
          Rentgen does not ask you to write assertions. And that’s intentional.
          Because Rentgen is not trying to prove your API is correct.
          It’s trying to expose how it behaves when inputs are imperfect.
        </p>

        <p>
          The model is brutally simple:
          <strong>2xx–3xx</strong> means “acceptable behaviour”,
          <strong>4xx</strong> means “your API handled bad input without panicking”,
          and <strong>everything else</strong> is a problem worth looking at.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’re not building a test suite here.
          You’re running a reality check.
        </p>

        <h2>Collections without ceremony</h2>
        <p>
          You group requests into collections. Your work stays saved.
          When you want to run them, you click <strong>Play</strong>.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img width=60% src="../assets/api-stories/rentgen-no-test-runner-just-press-play.gif" alt="Rentgen flow: Test runned without ceremony" />
          <figcaption>No test runners. No setup rituals. No ceremony.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          No test runners. No setup rituals. No pre-scripts. No post-scripts.
          No “wait, where is that environment variable defined?” nonsense.
          Just run the collection and see what breaks.
        </p>

        <h2>Environments that don’t get in the way</h2>
        <p>
          Rentgen supports environments, and it does it in a way that makes sense in the real world.
          Different environments have a color, so you instantly know where you are.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img width=60% src="../assets/api-stories/rentgen-environments-support-without-ceremony.gif" alt="Rentgen flow: cURL in, tests out" />
          <figcaption>Rentgen supports environments without ceremony.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          You can save response values into environments once, automatically, persistently.
          Next time you run the same collection, Rentgen knows how to reconnect the data —
          without scripts, without copy-paste, without pretending this is normal.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this is not competing with Postman</h2>
        <p>
          Postman is great at scripted testing, complex workflows, and detailed assertions.
          If that’s your job — keep using it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rentgen is for the moment before that — when a developer wants to answer one honest question:
          <strong>“Did we miss something obvious before handing this API to QA?”</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Run Rentgen first. Fix the stupid stuff. Then let testers do their job properly.
          Developers look more professional. Testers waste less time on low-hanging bugs.
          Everyone wins.
        </p>

        <h2>Built by a tester. Used by developers.</h2>
        <p>
          Rentgen wasn’t built to chase trends.
          No AI agents. No cloud sync. No telemetry. No accounts.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was built by someone who has tested APIs long enough to know the truth:
          most bugs come from boring input mistakes everyone thinks are “impossible”.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you already use Postman — great. Keep using it.
          Just run Rentgen <strong>before</strong> you say “it works”.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because “it works” usually means “I tried the happy path once”.
          And production doesn’t care about your happy path.
