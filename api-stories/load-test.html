        <h1>Built-in Load Test — when a little concurrency already bends your API</h1>

      <div class="article-content">
        <p>
          Load testing is one of those things everyone agrees is important —
          and almost nobody does early.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes because there is no time.
          Sometimes because setting up a proper tool feels heavy.
          Sometimes because “it works locally” and that feels good enough.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rentgen approaches this problem differently.
          Instead of replacing professional load-testing tools,
          it gives you a <strong>built-in, low-friction load test</strong>
          that answers one simple question:
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Does this API already slow down when a little concurrency is introduced?</em>
        </p>

        <h2>What this test is — and what it is not</h2>

        <p>
          Rentgen’s load test is not meant to simulate production traffic
          or push your infrastructure to its limits.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is intentionally small.
          Intentionally controlled.
          Intentionally easy to run.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal is not to break the system.
          The goal is to detect early performance degradation
          before it turns into a scaling problem.
        </p>

        <h2>What was tested</h2>
                
        <figure>
          <img width="100%" src="../assets/api-stories/load-test.png" alt="Build in load test" />
          <figcaption>Build in load test</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Rentgen executed a lightweight concurrent load test using the same API request
          that was already validated functionally.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Threads:</strong> 10</li>
          <li><strong>Total requests:</strong> 100</li>
          <li><strong>Execution:</strong> parallel</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          During execution, Rentgen measured response time percentiles
          and evaluated them against clear, opinionated thresholds.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Median &lt; 500 ms</strong> → Pass</li>
          <li><strong>Median &lt; 1000 ms</strong> → Warning</li>
          <li><strong>Median ≥ 1000 ms</strong> → Fail</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Rentgen found</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Requests executed:</strong> 100</li>
          <li><strong>p50:</strong> 511 ms</li>
          <li><strong>p90:</strong> 992 ms</li>
          <li><strong>p95:</strong> 1152 ms</li>
          <li><strong>Average:</strong> 574 ms</li>
          <li><strong>4xx errors:</strong> 0</li>
          <li><strong>5xx errors:</strong> 0</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Even under minimal concurrency,
          the median response time crossed the 500 ms threshold
          and high percentiles exceeded one second.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this matters</h2>

        <p>
          Ten parallel requests is not traffic.
          It is barely a warm-up.
        </p>

        <p>
          If an API starts slowing down at this level,
          it is usually a sign of deeper issues:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>inefficient database queries</li>
          <li>blocking I/O in request handling</li>
          <li>missing or ineffective caching</li>
          <li>N+1 query patterns</li>
          <li>thread or connection pool saturation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          None of these problems require real load to exist.
          They are already present — concurrency simply exposes them.
        </p>

        <h2>Why most teams miss this</h2>

        <p>
          Manual API testing is sequential.
          One request.
          One response.
          Everything looks fine.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the time someone runs a real load test,
          the API is already in production,
          the data set is large,
          and fixing performance becomes expensive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rentgen surfaces this earlier,
          while the API is still being actively developed.
        </p>

        <h2>The practical workflow</h2>

        <p>
          Running a load test in Rentgen requires two choices:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>number of threads (1–100)</li>
          <li>number of requests (1–10 000)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          That’s it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Need unique data per request?
          Use dynamic mappings — random strings, integers, or emails —
          directly in the request definition.
        </p>

        <p>
          No additional tools.
          No scripts.
          No setup ceremony.
        </p>

        <h2>What happens when it fails</h2>

        <p>
          When performance thresholds are exceeded,
          Rentgen marks the test accordingly
          and provides a ready-to-use bug report
          with all relevant metrics.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don’t need to explain why this is a problem.
          The numbers already do.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this check exists in Rentgen</h2>

        <p>
          Because performance problems rarely appear suddenly.
        </p>

        <p>
          They usually start small,
          hide behind “it works”,
          and grow quietly until real users feel the pain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rentgen’s built-in load test is designed to catch that moment early —
          when fixing it is still cheap.
        </p>

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

        <p>
          You don’t need a full performance lab
          to know when something is already wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a little concurrency bends your API,
          real traffic will break it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seeing that early is not pessimism.
          It’s engineering.
