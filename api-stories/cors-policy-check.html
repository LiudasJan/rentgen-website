      <div class="article-content">
        <p>
          CORS is not security in the classic sense.
          It doesn’t protect your API from attackers.
          What it does protect is something more fragile:
          <strong>how your API is used by browsers</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s why this check is informational.
          It doesn’t say “good” or “bad”.
          It answers a simpler question:
          <em>who is your API meant for?</em>
        </p>

        <h2>What was tested</h2>
        <p>
          Rentgen inspects CORS headers and determines whether the API is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Restricted by origin</strong> — only specific origins are allowed</li>
          <li><strong>Open / permissive</strong> — requests from any origin are allowed</li>
        </ul>

        <figure>
          <img width="100%" src="../assets/api-stories/cors-policy-check.png" alt="CORS policy check showing restricted and open origins in API responses" />
          <figcaption>Rentgen identifies whether an API is restricted by origin or publicly accessible</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>What Rentgen reports</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>TEST:</strong> CORS Policy Check</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> CORS Error → Private API (Restricted By Origin)</li>
          <li><strong>Status:</strong> <strong>🔵 Info</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why this is an info-level check</h2>
        <p>
          Because CORS configuration is not universally right or wrong.
          It only makes sense in context.
        </p>

        <p>
          A private API used by a single web application should almost always be
          <strong>restricted by origin</strong>.
          An external API designed for integrations should usually be
          <strong>accessible from any origin</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The mistake teams make is assuming one default fits all cases.
          It doesn’t.
        </p>

        <h2>Private API vs Public API — the simple rule</h2>
        <p>
          If your API is used only by your own web application,
          and especially if it relies on cookies or browser-managed credentials,
          then restricting origins is the correct choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          In that case, CORS acts as a guardrail:
          it prevents other websites from silently using your users’ sessions
          to make authenticated requests.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, if you are building an API as a product —
          meant to be called from many different domains and integrations —
          then strict origin restrictions can become an obstacle.
        </p>

        <h2>What OWASP says about it</h2>
        <p>
          OWASP treats CORS misconfiguration as a common risk,
          especially when combined with cookies or implicit authentication.
        </p>

        <p>
          The key point OWASP makes is simple:
          <strong>CORS should never be overly permissive by accident</strong>.
          Open origins are acceptable only when the authentication model
          does not rely on browser-managed credentials.
        </p>

        <p>
          In other words:
          open CORS is not the problem —
          open CORS combined with cookies is.
        </p>

        <h2>When open CORS can be acceptable</h2>
        <p>
          There are valid cases where allowing all origins is fine:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The API does not use cookies</li>
          <li>Authentication is done via explicit bearer tokens</li>
          <li>Tokens are stored in application code or local storage</li>
          <li>The browser does not automatically attach credentials</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In this model, CORS becomes less about protection
          and more about developer convenience.
          The browser cannot “leak” credentials it doesn’t automatically send.
        </p>

        <h2>Why teams still get this wrong</h2>
        <p>
          Because CORS lives in an uncomfortable space between frontend and backend.
        </p>

        <p>
          Backend teams often assume:
          “CORS is frontend stuff.”
          Frontend teams assume:
          “The backend knows what it’s doing.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The result is usually a copy-pasted configuration:
          <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>,
          added to “make things work” during development
          and quietly shipped to production.
        </p>

        <h2>Real-world impact</h2>
        <p>
          CORS issues rarely show up as dramatic breaches.
          They show up as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>unexpected browser errors</li>
          <li>integrations that work from curl but not from browsers</li>
          <li>APIs that cannot be reused outside their original app</li>
          <li>security reviews flagging “overly permissive CORS” late in the process</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          By the time someone notices, changing CORS often breaks existing clients.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Rentgen checks this</h2>
        <p>
          Not to judge.
          Not to fail.
          But to force the question early:
          <em>is this API private or public?</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Once that question is answered consciously,
          the correct CORS configuration usually becomes obvious.
        </p>

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          CORS won’t stop attackers.
          But it will absolutely shape how your API is used,
          misused, and integrated.
        </p>

        <p>
          Treat it as an architectural decision, not a checkbox.
          Rentgen marks this as <strong>Info</strong> for a reason —
          because understanding your intent matters more than blindly passing a test.
